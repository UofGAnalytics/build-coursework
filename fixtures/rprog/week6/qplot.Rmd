## Quick plots
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
load(url("http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/~levers/rp/w5.RData"))
```

The function `qplot` (or `quickplot`) provides a compact interface for simple `ggplot2` graphics. Its syntax is meant to resemble the syntax of `plot` in basic R.

The basic syntax of `qplot` is `qplot(x, y, data=data, geom=geom, ...)`. It plots `y` against `x` (taken from `data`) using the geometry `geom`. `geom` is specified as a string and without `geom_` (for example `geom="line"` instead of `geom_line`). `qplot` also accepts the optional arguments `log`, `main`, `sub`, `xlab`, `ylab`, `xlim` and `ylim`, which have similar effects as the arguments of that name have for `plot` in standard R graphics.


We can re-create the plot of life expectancy against health expenditure from last week using
```{r, dev.args=list(pointsize=10), fig.width=10, fig.height=6, out.width="\\textwidth"}
load(url("http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/~levers/rp/w5.RData"))
qplot(HealthExpenditure, LifeExpectancy, 
      data=health, colour=Region)
```

We can already see a major advantage of using `ggplot2`: we don't need to `unclass` Region and `ggplot2` has already drawn a legend for us.

`ggplot2` also allows for a graphical parameter `size`, which controls the size of the plotting symbol (on a square-root scale, so that the area of the plotting symbol is on a linear scale.)
```{r, dev.args=list(pointsize=10), fig.width=10, fig.height=6, out.width="\\textwidth"}
qplot(HealthExpenditure, LifeExpectancy, 
      data=health, colour=Region, size=Population)
```

####[task, label="ggplottask1"]
In this task we will use the data set `diamonds`  from `ggplot2`. Create a scatter plot of carat against price, using different colours to denote the different colour and different plotting symbols to denote the different cuts.

#####[answer]
We can use the following R code.

```{r, dev.args=list(pointsize=10), fig.width=10, fig.height=6, out.width="\\textwidth"}
qplot(carat, price, data=diamonds, colour=color, shape=cut)
```
