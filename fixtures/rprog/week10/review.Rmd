## Review exercises

###[task]
The package `nycflights13` contains a tibble `flights` containing data on all domestic flights which departed NYC (JFK, LGA or EWR) in 2013. 

(a) Create an R Markdown report titled "Flights out of NYC on 01/01/2013". The report should just determine the number of flights that have left NYC on January 1st, 2013.  The resulting report should look like the [sample available online](http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/~levers/rp/t5_3a.pdf).

(b) Change your report from part (a) so that it does not show the R code or output, but contains the paragraph shown below. The resulting report should look like the [sample available online](http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/~levers/rp/t5_3b.pdf).
```
     On 01/01/2013, [PUT NUMBER OF FLIGHTS HERE] flights left NYC. 
```
  

(c) Add to your report a table with the ten most frequent destination showing the airport code, airport name, and the number of flights. Full airport names are available in the tibble `airports`. The resulting report should look like the [sample available online](http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/~levers/rp/t5_3c.pdf).

(d) Add to your report a plot of the destinations served on that day. Longitude and latitude of the airports are available in the tibble `airports`. The resulting report should look like the [sample available online](http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/~levers/rp/t5_3d.pdf). 

	To draw a map of the US with all airports shown you can use
```r
library(ggmap)
map <- get_map(location = c(lon = -97.5, lat = 40), zoom=4)
ggmap(map) +
    geom_point(aes(lon, lat), data=airports, alpha=0.25) 
``` 


(e) Make your report parameterised and use it to generate a report for July 4th.
The resulting report should look like the [sample available online](http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/~levers/rp/t5_3e.pdf).
