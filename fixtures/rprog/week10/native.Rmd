## Using knitr without Rmarkdown

Markdown has many strengths (ease of use, ability to convert to many output formats, etc.), however one weakness is that Markdown does not give you fine-grain control over detailed aspects of the layout.

If you are familiar with HTML or LaTeX, you can also embed knitr chunks in these documents while retaining fine-grain control of how the content is rendered.

### knitr chunks in HTML documents

`knitr` code chunks can be included in HTML using 

```{r,include=FALSE}
source("trick.R")
```

`r I(printfile("HTMLsrc.Rmd"))`

Inline `knitr` expressions in HTML use the syntax `r I(paste0(backtick,"<","!--rinline #R expression goes here --",">",backtick))`.

The file containing the HTML with the R chunks should then be saved as a `.Rhtml` file. This file can then be knitted in RStudio by clicking in the *Knit* button. Alternatively, you can run
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knit("report.Rhtml")
```

`r I(printfile("example6.Rhtml"))`

### knitr chunks in LaTeX documents (Rnw files)

`knitr` code chunks can be included in [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) documents using standard ["noweb"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noweb) syntax.

```
<<#chunk-options>>=
# R code goes here
@          
```        
Inline `knitr` expressions in LaTeX use the syntax `\Sexpr{#R expression goes here}`. If you are wondering about the name of the command: R is a re-implementation of the S engine and a key concept in the implementation of both R and S is an S expression (`SEXP` in C code).

The file containing the LaTeX code with the R chunks is then saved as `.Rnw` file. The file can then be compiled into a PDF file by clicking on the PDF icon in RStudio. The file can be translated into a LaTeX file using
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knit("report.Rnw")
```
You then need to run LaTeX to convert the TeX file into a PDF document.

`r I(printfile("example7.Rnw"))`

####[background]Sweave
`knitr` was inspired by `Sweave`, the literate programming functionality built into base R. The basic syntax of `knitr` for LaTeX is very similar to the one used by `Sweave`. More information about `Sweave` is available in the [Sweave manual](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/doc/Sweave.pdf).
