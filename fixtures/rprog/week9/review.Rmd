## Review exercises

###[task]
In this task you will write a Shiny app which illustrates the probability mass function (p.m.f.) and cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.) of the binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution.

- Write a Shiny app which plots the p.m.f. and c.d.f. of the binomial distribution. The side bar should show a slider for the sample size $n$ and the probability of success $\theta$. The main panel should show a plot of the p.m.f., which you can obtain using the function  `dbinom`, and a plot of the c.d.f., which you can obtain using the function `pbinom`.
- Write a Shiny app which plots the p.m.f. and c.d.f. of the Poisson distribution. The side bar should show a slider for the rate parameter $\lambda$. The main panel should show a plot of the p.m.f., which you can obtain using the function  `dpois`, and a plot of the c.d.f., which you can obtain using the function `ppois`.  
- Combine both apps into one, letting the user choose between the binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution.
- Add a tickbox "Show normal approximation" which adds the probability density function (p.d.f.) and c.d.f. of the $\textsf{N}(n\theta, n\theta(1-\theta))$ distribution to the plots of the binomial distribution and the $\textsf{N}(\theta,\theta)$ distribution to the plots of the Poisson distribution.
- For the binomial distribution, add a tickbox "Show Poisson approximation", which adds the p.m.f. and c.d.f. of the Poisson distribution with rate $n\theta$ to the plots for the binomial distribution. 
- If you have not yet already done so, add a legend to your plots.

###[task]
In this task you will write a Shiny app which illustrates the crabs data from `MASS`.
  
The data contains several morphological measurements of crabs of two species (column `sp`) and both sexes (column `sex`). The statistical objective is to use the morphological measurements to tell the two species apart (though the two species are called "blue" and "orange", their colour is pretty much the same). The data contains the following variables. 


| Column name | Variable |
|-------------|--------------------------|
|`sp` | species - "B" for "blue" and "O" for "orange"|
|`sex` | gender of the animal| 
|`index` | index counter |
|`FL` | frontal lobe size (mm)|
|`RW` | rear width (mm)|
|`CL` | carapace length (mm)|
|`CW` | carapace width (mm)|
|`BD` | body depth (mm)|

-  Write a Shiny app which plots the variables carapace width (`CW`) and body depth (`BD`) against each other. 
- Use two select inputs "dropdowns" to let the user choose which numerical variables are used in the plot.
(`gplot2` has the aesthetics function `aes_string` which takes the variable names as strings (for example `aes_string(x="CW", y="BD", colour="sex")`, rather than `aes(x=CW, y=BD, colour=sex)`. Using `aes_string` makes it easy to use inputs from Shiny to specify plots aesthetics.)
- Use a select input  to let the user choose whether colour is used to represent sex, species or nothing. Add another select input for the plotting symbol, with the same choices.
- Distinguishing between species and gender gets a lot easier when relative proportions are plotted (say `RW`/`BD` against `CW`/`BD`). Add a control that lets the user choose whether to plot relative proportions and if so which numerical variable to use as denominator when taking ratios.
