## Plotting in R

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width=6, fig.height=6, out.width=".67\\textwidth") 
```

###[video, videoid="BaZD5uKApdg", duration="11m57s"]
The video gives an overview over the key high-level plotting functions in R. The remaining sections of this chapter explain the underlying functions in more detail. The course *Learning from Data- Data Science Foundations* will look at choosing appropriate statistical plots in more detail.

R has a built-in sophisticated and customisable plotting engine. which we will look at this week.

To get an idea of what R can do, enter
```r
demo(graphics)
```

R is widely used for data visualisation: the New York Times has been [using R to create some of the graphics in the newspaper and on its website](https://www.r-bloggers.com/amanda-cox-on-using-r-at-the-nyt/).

Chapter 4 of Dalgaard's book explains how to create basic statistical plots in R and how to interpret them. This can be obtained from the library free [here](https://glasgow.summon.serialssolutions.com/#!/search?bookMark=ePnHCXMw42JgAfZbU5khE6Og45_AK9eA1RToWltTEw7YAIgBeN-uMSeDnCdoTTbodNP8okoF0D4ayBHFCqCRSIUgbgYFN9cQZw9dUHMyPb88HjquEZ9kBGwYmlgYgW4mIKgEAHEUKiI)
