## Alternatives

### ggplot2
The package [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) is by far the most popular R package for graphics. It provides a declarative and simple, yet powerful interface for creating sophisticated graphics. We will look at ggplot2 in week 6.

### lattice
The package [lattice](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice) used to be popular before the advent of ggplot. It provides "Trellis"-like high-level plot functions (named after the [plotting library for S-Plus](http://ect.bell-labs.com/sl/project/trellis/s.html)) and has inspired some of the functionality of ggplot. 

### 3D plots using rgl
The package [rgl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rgl/index.html)  allows for creating more sophisticated 3D plots using OpenGL. [OpenGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL) is a cross-platform 3D graphics rendering engine like DirectX under Windows. OpenGL is highly sophisticated: it supports advanced features like translucent objects, textured surfaces, light effects and even reflective surfaces. The package rgl allows rendering 3D plots through OpenGL. `rgl` plots can be spun using your mouse.

####[example]
We can create a 3D `rgl` scatter plot of the health expenditure data using
```r
library(rgl)
plot3d(health[,4:6], type="s", radius=1e7, col=unclass(health$Region), alpha=0.5)
```

### Javascript libraries 
If you want to publish your plots on the web it is worth considering JavaScript-based plotting libraries such as [plotly](https://plot.ly/) or [D3](https://d3js.org/). Plots generated from R are static images whereas these libraries allow for user interaction. 

The package [plotly](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plotly/) allows creating plotly graphics from R. Note however that you need an API key from plotly so that you can use the plotly service for hosting your plot. Without an API key you can only view the graphics locally.

The documentation for the R interface to plotly contains a large number of examples.

Integrating R and D3 is slightly more complicated, but can be done using the R package [R2D3](https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/). It however still requires to to construct the D3 plot in Javascript. It is possible to use d3 plots in Shiny (we will look at shiny later on in this course).
