## Calling R functions

###[video, videoid="IUhA7qpgs6Q", duration="8m36s"] Calling an R function

So far, we have used many different R functions: `rnorm`, `cbind`, etc.
When we called these functions, we usually passed on some information
("arguments") to the function. For example we used the command
`rnorm(10)` to create a sequence of white noise of length 10. This
section explains the formal rules R uses to match arguments.

Consider the example of the function `dnorm`. According to its help
page, its arguments are:
```r
dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1, log = FALSE)
```
`dnorm` computes the p.d.f. of the $\textsf{N}(\texttt{mean},\texttt{sd}^2)$ distribution (or the logarithm if `log=TRUE`).

To evaluate the p.d.f. of the $N(0.5,1)$ distribution at $x=-2$ we can
use any of the following lines (and many other variants on the theme):

```r
dnorm(-2, mean=0.5, sd=1)
dnorm(-2, 0.5, 1)
dnorm(0.5, 1, x=-2)
dnorm(x=-2, mean=0.5)
```

The reason as to why all the above commands work is that arguments in R
are handled in a much more flexible way compared to other programming
languages such as C or Java.

In R arguments can be given in two different forms:

- Named form:  Arguments are given in the form `name=value`, i.e. `dnorm(x=-2, mean=0.5)`. Arguments in named form can be in any order. The name of the argument does not need to be given in full as long as it is unique, i.e. you can use `dnorm(x=-2, m=0.5)`: in this case R will interpret  `m` as `mean`, as there are no other arguments starting with the letter "m".
- Positional form: In positional form no `name`s are given. In this case, R matches the  arguments by their position. For `dnorm` for example, the first argument is, according to the function definition, `x`, and the second argument is `mean`, thus R interprets `dnorm(-2, 0.5)` as `dnorm(x=-2, mean=0.5)`.

You can also use a mixture of named form and positional form. In this case R first matches the named arguments, and then matches the remaining arguments using their position. Let's look at the example `dnorm(0.5, 1, x=-2)` in more detail. R first matches the named arguments, in our case `x=-2`. The remaining arguments of the function `dnorm` are `mean`, `sd`, and `log`. The remaining arguments of our call are `0.5, 1`, so R interprets this as `mean=0.5` and `sd=1`.

Some arguments have default values and only need to be specified if you want to set this argument to a different value. This is typically (but not always) visible in the function declaration, e.g. `sd` of `dnorm` defaults to $1$ ("`sd=1`"). Thus if we do not specify `sd`, we implicitly set `sd=1`.

Some functions allow unspecified arguments ("..."); we will come back to this later.

###[task] 
Consider a function taking arguments `a`, `b` and `c` and returning $(a+2\times b)^c$, defined as set out below.
```r
func <-  function(a, b=0, c=1) {
    (a+2*b)^c
}
```

Rewrite the calls below into named form (i.e. using `parameter=value`) and give the output of `func` without running it in R.
```r
func(1, 2, 3)
func(4)
func(c=3, 2, 1)
```
####[answer]
The call 
```r
func(1,2,3)
```
is equivalent to 
```r
func(a=1, b=2, c=3)
```
and calculates $(1+2\times 2)^3=5^3=125$.

The call 
```r
func(4)
```
is equivalent to 
```r
func(a=4, b=0, c=1)
```
(default values are used for `b` and `c`) and calculates $(4+0\times 2)^1=4^1=4$.

The call 
```r
func(c=3, 2, 1)
```
is equivalent to 
```r
func(a=2, b=1, c=3)
```
and calculates $(2+1\times 2)^3=4^3=64$.
