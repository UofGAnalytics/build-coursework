## General Information: Advanced Predictive Models

### Course description

This course is about models which can account for a non-normal distribution of the response and/or the fact that data is not independent, but correlated.


The course lecturer is Tereza Neocleous (email: <tereza.neocleous@glasgow.ac.uk>).


###[video, videoid="ApZu75PkEXw", duration="1m36s"] Introduction to Advanced Predictive Models

### Aims


The aims of this course are:

-	to provide an overview of different generalisations of linear regression models

-	to acquaint students with the theory of exponential families

-	to introduce generalised linear models

-	to introduce the concept of a time series and to present a range of approaches for representing trends and seasonality 

-	to illustrate how temporal correlation can be incorporated into a regression model

-	to illustrate how random effects can be incorporated into a regression model



### Intended learning outcomes

By the end of this course students will be able to:

-   explain and derive key aspects of the theory of exponential families and generalised linear models;
 
-   make correct use of models with various link functions and link distributions such as models for discrete data;

-   determine whether a time series exhibits any evidence of a trend, seasonality or short-term correlation;   
 
-   define the class of ARIMA probability models;

-   determine an appropriate model for a data set from the class of ARIMA models;

-   predict future values for a given time series;

-   make correct use of regression models assuming correlated residuals as well as models based on generalised estimation equations;

-   explain the notion of a random effect, why and when it is useful and, in particular, how it differs from a fixed effect;

-   make correct use of hierarchical models with random effects.

### Course materials and schedule

Course materials will be released on the [course Moodle page](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=22731) and on Microsoft Teams.  The course is split into [Part 1](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a1da2f3242332432c801bfb932de433c3%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=455c7967-6998-4823-9799-9eb1ae8da640&tenantId=6e725c29-763a-4f50-81f2-2e254f0133c8) and [Part 2](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a75a3aed5e25a4617a53993df8397afef%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=3c0e1523-cc2a-4e81-a597-bab1e85d0c14&tenantId=6e725c29-763a-4f50-81f2-2e254f0133c8) in Teams. Please use the team code **84vroua** to join Part 1 and **m2u9cgm** to join Part 2. 

Please note that while the notes will be available from both Moodle and Teams, assessments will be submitted on Moodle. 

The course is split into two parts, Part 1 on Generalised Linear Models, and Part 2 on time series analysis and models for correlated responses. There is a midterm break between the two parts during the week of 7th June 2021.The course will consist of the following topics:

#### Part 1:

  - Week 1 (beginning 3 May 2021) - Introduction and course information
  - Week 2 (beginning 10 May 2021) - Generalized linear models: what are they, estimation and inference
  - Week 3 (beginning 17 May 2021) - Models for binary/binomial response
  - Week 4 (beginning 24 May 2021) - Models for ordinal/nominal response
  - Week 5 (beginning 31 May 2021) - Models for counts
  
#### Part 2:

  - Week 6 (beginning 14 June 2021) - Introduction to time series data, trend and seasonality
  - Week 7 (beginning 21 June 2021) - Autoregressive and moving average processes and the ARIMA approach 
  - Week 8 (beginning 28 June 2021) - Forecasting in time series analysis
  - Week 9 (beginning 5 July 2021) - Models for correlated observations: random effects, mixed model approach
  - Week 10 (beginning 12 July 2021) - Models for correlated discrete responses



### Assessment and feedback calendar

Assessment is 100% coursework as shown below. If you are having issues with any of the deadlines, please email Tereza to request an extension.

### Interactive Zoom sessions 
 
There will be live Question & Answer sessions on Tuesdays from 13:00-14:00 UK time (BST) [(invite link here)](Join URL: https://uofglasgow.zoom.us/j/98180064888?pwd=ekJDbVJMSEx0aTlaNENwbmhFRkFQdz09). These are an opportunity to ask any questions you may have about the course. They will be recorded with the recordings made available later for anyone who cannot attend. 

**Q&A chat:** I would also encourage you to use the Teams chat functionality to post and answer questions. This can often get your questions answered faster than waiting for one of the scheduled Zoom sessions.
