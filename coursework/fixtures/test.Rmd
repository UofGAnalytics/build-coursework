## Vectors in R

So far we have only looked at scalar variables, i.e. variables containing only one value. In most programming languages such scalar variables are the basic data types. R however does not have scalar variables, all variables are vectors. A variable storing a number is for example just a numeric vector of length 1.

```r
a <- c(1, 4, 2)
a
```

```{r}
a <- c(1, 4, 2)
a
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
a <- c(1, 4, 2)
a
```

```{r,echo=TRUE}
a <- c(1, 4, 2)
a
```

``` {r,a=1,b=2,c=3}
a <- c(1, 4, 2)
a
```

``` {r,1=a,2=b,3=c}
a <- c(1, 4, 2)
a
```
